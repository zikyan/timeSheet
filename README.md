So I had a couple of thoughts about doing this challenge. First, I was doing this project on the local storage of reactjs instead of doing this on a real-time database such as MongoDB. Doing this on local storage became very complex for me and was not doing up to the expectations then I thought that I should do this with nodejs and MongoDB but this was a small project and doing this with node was not a good approach because putting much effort to make node server and the MongoDB for such a small project and it would have taken more time with node.

Finally, I decided that going with firebase is the best approach for this, no need to hassle with node server, etc just a small crud thing with firebase. Then I made the app again for the firebase because changing the previous one with local storage logic was giving me irritation.

Now if I would be given a day more I'll add the login signup functionality and if given a year then convert it into a full-fledged attendance and tracking an employee working time with a face detection attendance system using deep learning.
